**Homepage**
   -   ![Desktop home page lighthouse result](assets/images/readme-images/desktop-homepage-lighthouse.jpg)
   -   ![Mobile home page lighthouse result](assets/images/readme-images/mobile-homepage-lighthouse.jpg)

**Our Gyms Page**
   -   ![Desktop Our Gyms page lighthouse result](assets/images/readme-images/desktop-our-gyms-page-lighthouse.jpg)
   -   ![Mobile Our Gyms page lighthouse result](assets/images/readme-images/mobile-ourgyms-page-lighthouse.jpg)

**Contact Page**
   -   ![Desktop contact page lighthouse result](assets/images/readme-images/desktop-contact-page-lighthouse.jpg)
   -   ![Mobile contact page lighthouse result](assets/images/readme-images/mobile-contact-page-lighthouse.jpg)

### Bugs
### Unfixed bugs
On the Home page i failed to get higher than a 91 SEO score on the lighthouse result. When linking to sections on Our Gyms page from the Home page navigation bar, lighthouse is asking for more descriptive link text but i can't seem to achieve this.

This only seems to occur when linking to sections on another page using "#".

### Fixed bugs
I was getting a poor performance score on my Home page and Our gyms page on mobiles. This was massively improved by creating smaller versions of my images and only using them for mobile screens.
